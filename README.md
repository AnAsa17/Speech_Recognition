# Speech_Recognition
Speech_Recognition
The project aims to develop a system for identifying the region of living of an individual based on the language they speak, utilizing speech-processing techniques. With the increasing globalization and mobility of populations, linguistic diversity has become a prominent feature of society. Leveraging advancements in speech recognition and language detection, this project seeks to address the challenge of identifying regional dialects and accents from spoken language samples.
By developing a robust system for identifying regions of living based on spoken language, this project aims to contribute to various domains, including sociolinguistics, law enforcement, national security, and cross-cultural communication. Ethical considerations such as privacy, surveillance, and potential biases in language profiling are addressed to ensure responsible and transparent deployment of the technology.
